Sentiment analysis is extracting the perception, which indicates a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, of people towards a particular issue, brand, scheme, etc., from textual data. It has a wide range of applications, from brand monitoring, product review analysis to policymaking.

A hashtag is a type of metadata tag allowing users to apply dynamic, user- generated tagging which makes it possible for others to easily find the message with a specific theme or content. Since its introduction to the mainstream Internet, hashtags become an indispensable tool to group content on social media.

For this project, tweets from Twitter will be used as text analysis to suggest possible hashtags. It is the basic binary classification for natural language processing (NLP) problems. Specifically, Google's BERT method will be introduced into the prediction model based on the Naive Bayes Classifier.
